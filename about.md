title: About Me
description: About Lucas F. Costa
---

I was born in an island in southern Brazil. The weather there was too nice, so I had to go live in London for five years. Now that I'm back, I miss the tea, the tube, and the drizzle. Besides prose, I write JavaScript, TypeScript, and a bit of Rust.

Currently, I'm an engineer at [Resend](https://resend.com). Resend acquired my previous company, [Briefer](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/briefer), which went through the Y Combinator S23 batch.

I'm passionate about open-source. Previously, I have been a maintainer of [Chai.js](http://chaijs.com/) and [Sinon.js](http://sinonjs.org/). I'm very active on [GitHub](https://github.com/lucasfcosta) and have contributed to numerous projects, including [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) and [NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io/).

As an author, I've written [*Testing JavaScript Applications*](https://www.manning.com/books/testing-javascript-applications), a book published by [Manning Publications](https://www.manning.com/).

I like opinionated books, beautiful code, well-engineered prose, command-line interfaces, and vim. In fact, I like vim so much that [I got a `:w` tattoed on my ankle](/assets/vimtattoo.jpg).

Content that I *own* is always up for grabs. Universities and online courses use some of these posts as reference material, and you can do the same if you want.

I have been voluntarily translated into many languages, including German, Korean, Russian, Mandarin, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. If you wish to translate any of these posts, you do *not* need to ask for permission. _You can just do things_.

Everything I produce belongs to the internet. It has made me who I am, and, therefore, it deserves all I have.
