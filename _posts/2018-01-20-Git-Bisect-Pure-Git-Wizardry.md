**Git's `bisect` command is one of those things you will wish you've known since you started using `git` at all.**

I don't use it that often, but whenever I do I ask myself how did I live without this for so long. Since many people I talk to are not aware that `git bisect` exists, maybe it would be cool to teach more engineers out there about this ~~time~~life-saving tool.



## ***First things first, what is `git bisect`?***

Git's `bisect` command is a tool forged in the Olympus by all of the most powerful gods that ever existed for the delight of human software engineers. **It allows you to find the commit that introduced a bug**.

**Finding bad commits is its primary utility, but you can actually use it to efficiently find any commits that match certain criteria**, as I will show you later.

Let's say you've added 7 commits on your `my-feature` branch and someone merged a new PR on `master` with a few new integration tests you didn't have in your branch. Then you rebased your branch on `master` and now you've got failing tests. How would you find the commit that caused it to fail?

Well, before reading this blog post maybe you would start investigating the tip of your current branch (which has all those changes) or try rolling back commits one-by-one and re-running tests manually. Fortunately, **your life has just changed and from now on you will use `git bisect`** (yes, I do like being hyperbolic). `bisect` will then efficiently help you finding which commit caused that.



## ***Cool, but how do I actually use it?***

In the situation I've just described in the previous section, the first thing you would do is start `bisect` by running:

```console
$ git bisect start
```

Then you need to tell `git` which revision (which `commit`, practically speaking) is bad. The command below tells `git` that the current revision is bad:

```console
$ git bisect bad
```

Please notice that the bad commit doesn't necessarily need to be the one on the top of your branch, you can flag any commit as a `bad` commit by adding the commit you want to flag just after the command above. If the hash of the commit you want to flag starts with `c77eb11` you could do this, for example:

```console
$ git bisect bad c77eb11
```

After flagging the first bad commit you need to flag the first good commit you know. In order to do this you can just do `git bisect good` followed by the hash of the commit you want to flag:

```console
$ git bisect good 4bdb7e8
```

Git will then checkout the commit in the middle of the range between those two and show you how many revisions need to be tested in order to find the bad commit, like this:

```
Bisecting: 3 revisions left to test after this (roughly 2 steps)
```

Now you need to run the tests and tell Git whether the current revision is good or bad. You can do that using the same commands as you used to flag commits initially:

```
$ git bisect good
$ # or
$ git bisect bad
```

After you flag the revision Git has just checked out it will move on to checking out the next one that needs to be tested and you must flag it too. Keep doing this for each revision Git checks out and then, when there are no revisions left to test, it will show you which is the first commit that does not work.

**If you want to see the full list of revisions and their statuses (either `good` or `bad`) you can use `git bisect log`** and you will see an output that looks like the following:

```console
git bisect start
# bad: [1de25cdbbfe650dafb7b62d65b87baee56afc662] Add post about JS Fatigue
git bisect bad 1de25cdbbfe650dafb7b62d65b87baee56afc662
# good: [2529e01ce77e0f41c158c0ee6d138c5103457560] Fix factorial example
git bisect good 2529e01ce77e0f41c158c0ee6d138c5103457560
# good: [4bdb7e87f8bbde7243aa227aa4b576a40ba69f7e] Update about me section
git bisect good 4bdb7e87f8bbde7243aa227aa4b576a40ba69f7e
# bad: [3d16abba7b136fcd7cf959ba8ee5530ed1fa90da] Add Big-O blogpost
git bisect bad 3d16abba7b136fcd7cf959ba8ee5530ed1fa90da
# bad: [4b89555ab3e69f3417daef77518226a5e6a03a88] Change email
git bisect bad 4b89555ab3e69f3417daef77518226a5e6a03a88
# first bad commit: [4b89555ab3e69f3417daef77518226a5e6a03a88] Change email
```

Almost there but made a mistake? No worries! As you might have noticed, the output of `git bisect log` is formatted as a reproducible script, which means you can save the contents of `git log` to a file (by doing `git bisect log > bisect_log` for example), edit it and then use `git bisect replay <filename>` (in this case you will replace `<filename>` by `bisect_log`) to redo what you have done until that point.

If Git automatically checked out a commit you don't want to test for some reason (maybe it has an unrelated bug so you can't run your scripts accurately) you can just use `git bisect skip`. However, this might cause your problem this is what [the official docs for `git bisect` (which you should definitely read too)](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect) says:

> If you skip a commit adjacent to the one you are looking for, Git will be unable to tell exactly which of those commits was the first bad one.

Once you have discovered which commit is the one that introduced the problem you were tracking down (or if you just want to end `bisect`) you can use `git bisect reset` to reset the `bisect` state and go back to the top of the branch you were (the original `HEAD`).



## ***Automating Git Bisect***

As if `git bisect` wasn't already good enough, you can also automate it so you won't even need to keep testing each one of the commits Git checks out (this means you can go grab another cup of coffee while Git does all the hard work for you, as machines are supposed to).

In order to do that you just need to start `git bisect` as I have explained previously:

```console
$ git bisect start
```

And flag the first `good` and `bad` commits (also in the same way we've done before).

Now you can just use `git bisect run <command> <arguments>`. Please notice that your `command` must exit with status code `0` for success or a status code from `1` to `127` (excluding `125`). Since almost all test runners already do that right out of the box (at least all the good ones do), if you have any unit tests you're good to go.

So let's say you're using JavaScript and you run your tests by using `npm test`, all you need to do is run the following command after you have defined which is the first `good`  and the first `bad` commit:

```console
$ git bisect run npm test
```

Now go for a quick walk or go check [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and make sure the cryptocurrencies you own haven't made you a billionaire yet on [CoinMarketCap](coinmarketcap.com). When you come back to your terminal you will see which commit is the guilty one.



## ***Git Bisect Behind the Scenes***

**Bisect is nothing but a binary search** on commits which depends on you being able to tell whether a commit is good or bad.

Let's say you have flagged the commit on the top of your branch as `good` and then, 14 commits before it, you have flagged a commit as `bad`, which means you've got a range of 15 commits. This is what Git will do:



<BlogImage src="/assets/bisect-tree-1.png" alt="The first step Git bisect will do" />



Then, when you flag the commit it has checked out as `good` or `bad`, it will be able to tell whether it should go forward or backward. If you flag a revision as `good` it means the bug must have happened sometime in the future. If you flag a revision as `bad` it means the bug might have already been present before this one.

In this case, let's say that the 8th commit is already broken. This means that it's possible for the bug to have happened before, so Git will then checkout the commit in the middle of the range between the first and 8th commits: the 4th.



<BlogImage src="/assets/bisect-tree-2.png" alt="Git bisect second step - checking out middle commit" />



Now, telling git that the 4th commit is `good` is the same as telling it that the bug must have happened sometime in the future since all commits until this point in history will be considered `good` too. Git will then checkout the commit in the middle of the range between this `good` commit and the next `bad` one.

<BlogImage src="/assets/bisect-tree-3.png" alt="Git bisect third step - narrowing down the search" />

By flagging the 6th commit as `bad` we also tell Git that this might not be the first `bad` commit and therefore we must go back to the middle of the range between this `bad` commit and the last `good` one. In this case, we only have one commit left to check (the 5th one).

If the 5th commit is `good` it means that the revision just after it is guilty, if it's `bad` it will be considered the first commit to present the faulty behavior due to the fact that the revision just before it has been considered `good`.

<BlogImage src="/assets/bisect-tree-4.png" alt="Git bisect fourth step - continuing the binary search" />

This will be the final state of the bisection we've just run. As you can see, by doing a binary search `bisect` is able to find the last `good` commit and the first `bad` one by assuming that as soon as you mark a commit as `good`, all the ones before it are considered `good` as well and as soon as you mark a commit as bad, it assumes that all the ones after it are bad too.

## ***Finding Changes***

By now might think that I've forgotten about teaching you how to detect when a certain change has been introduced, but I didn't!

You could certainly run `git bisect start` and then mark every version without the feature as `good` and every version with the feature as `bad`. You could even create a script which checks this for you and then combine it with `git bisect run`. But that does not seem very semantic, does it?

Fortunately, the folks who write Git are awesome people and they thought about this. Instead of using `bad` and `good` you can simply use `old` for revisions which do not include that change and `new` for commits that do.

Like this:

```console
$ git bisect old # this revision does not contain the change
$ git bisect good # this revision contains the change
```



## ***Finding Anything***

And the awesomeness continues.

You can find anything using `bisect` and still use semantic terms to show your peers how good of a hacker you are, [just like Hugh Jackman on Swordfish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1Ds9CeG-VY).

Let's say you're looking for a certain change that made one of your buttons yellow instead of cyan (two colors that go really well on a red background). You could then remap `good` or `bad` to `cyan` and `yellow`, respectively, by using the following command:

```console
$ git bisect start --term-bad yellow --term-new cyan
```

Now look how cool you are using `yellow` and `cyan` to flag your revisions:

```
$ git bisect yellow # This version has a yellow button
$ git bisect cyan # This version has a cyan button
```



## ***Further Reading***

This post is just an attempt to make `git bisect` more popular and accessible for everyone, so if you want more detailed information or if you want to go learn a few more tricks make sure you read these two pages from Git's own docs. People have done a great job writing those:

* [Git Bisect Docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect)
* [Fighting regressions with git bisect, git-blame](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect-lk2009.html)
