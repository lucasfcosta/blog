GUIs are bloatware. [I've said it before](/2018/08/05/In-Praise-of-Plaintext.html). However, rather than just complaining about IDEs I'd like to provide an understandable guide to a much better alternative: the terminal.

*IDE* stands for Integrated Development Environment. This might be an accurate term, but when it comes to a *real integrated* development environment, the terminal is a lot better.

In this post, I'll walk you through everything you need to start making your terminal a complete development environment: how to edit text efficiently, configure its appearance, run and combine a myriad of programs, and dynamically create, resize and close tabs and windows.

# La Raison D'ÃŠtre

In an IDE you can only use plugins made specifically for it, in a terminal you can use any program. An IDE limits you to the extent of what their creators envisioned you would want to do. The terminal, on the other hand, allows you to combine many programs easily. Thanks to streams you can use a program's output as the input to another. They provide flexibility and enable creative use of diverse sets of tools for purposes their authors might have never imagined. That's one of the most remarkable characteristics of programs designed according to the UNIX philosophy.

> Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and other Microsoft programs have intimate â€” one might say promiscuous â€” knowledge of each others' internals. In Unix, one tries to design programs to operate not specifically with each other, but with programs as yet unthought of.
> â€” Doug McIlroy

GUI's learning curves are less steep than the terminal's learning curve, but the more you get used to plain-text, the easier it becomes to type commands rather than to search for options or buttons. The hard part is to remember which commands to type.

IDEs also tend to do too much "magic". They hide essential details from the user for the sake of practicality, which makes it harder to determine the real cause of a problem. There are two main reasons for this. The first is that all this abstraction makes people utterly unaware of what the computer is doing. The second is that IDEs do an excessive number of operations in the click of a button, which makes it harder to break down the process and diagnose which part is defective.

Now you might argue that some IDEs have small windows with console interfaces that provide you with the same output as a terminal would, and that's true. However, it's not enough. If you are still unaware of how to communicate with the machine in front of you in its own terms, you won't be able to make any sense of what that IDE is showing. Being comfortable in a terminal means speaking the same language as the machine does.

Configuration for terminal programs is also extremely portable. To configure most programs all you need to do is copy a plain-text file to the correct directory. Doing this allows you to set up a complete development environment in a new machine in a matter of seconds or, at most, a few minutes.

Configuration files for terminal programs â€” generally called `dotfiles` â€” are much more amicable than configuration files for IDEs. Dotfiles are human readable and contain plain-text. They also become much less coupled with your projects than IDE configurations would be. When you use an IDE configuration file to describe how the computer should build your code you enforce everyone in your team to use the same tool. On the other hand, when you use `make`, for example, you give people the freedom to choose how they want to run `make`'s targets, whether it be in a terminal or an IDE.

All the effort invested into becoming a skilled terminal user will soon pay-off. Since most of the time you are thinking rather than coding, saving a few key-strokes or milliseconds doesn't make that much difference. The real benefit of using the terminal is having a better comprehension of how your computer works and making your workflow more predictable and customizable.

Finally, being proficient with a terminal is a "learn-once-use-everywhere" â€” and "use-frequently" â€” skill. Not every machine has VSCode, Sublime or Atom installed, but every machine has a terminal.




# The Terminal Starter Pack

These are the main programs I use to make my terminal a complete development environment:

* [`neovim`](https://neovim.io)
* [`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
* [`iterm2`](https://www.iterm2.com)
* [`zsh`](http://www.zsh.org/) and [`oh-my-zsh`](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

At the end of this post you can find a list of other useful programs.




# `neovim`

`vim` is my text-editor of choice and has a special place in my heart [and my ankle](/assets/vimtattoo.jpg).

**`neovim` is another version of `vim`**. It has all of `vim`'s standard keybindings, the same features, and is fully compatible with `vim` configuration options.

To avoid the annoying seconds in which `vim` would freeze during tasks like syntax-checks, `neovim` lets you run jobs asynchronously.

It also supports scripts not only written in VimL â€” not my favourite language, let's put it like that â€” but also scripts written in [LUA](https://www.lua.org/home.html).

To make sure you are always using `nvim` rather than `vim`, you can alias the `vim` command to `nvim` by using the lines below. You can put them on your `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, or whatever configuration file for the shell you are using.

```
alias vim="nvim"
alias vimdiff="nvim -d"
```




## Learning `vim`

Even though many people fear `vim` and ["how to quit `vim`" is one of the most popular questions on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/05/23/stack-overflow-helping-one-million-developers-exit-vim/), `vim` is better mainly because it is different.

**For learning to use `vim` effectively I'd highly recommend starting with [`vimtutor`](https://superuser.com/questions/246487/how-to-use-vimtutor)**. It will seem boring in the beginning, but it is the most effective way of learning vim properly.

**Resist the urge to quit**. If you don't know how to accomplish a particular task, duck-duck-go it. In the first few days or weeks, you will have to remember which keys and commands do which things actively, but as time goes they will become deeply ingrained into your brain and editing text will be just like muscle memory.

**Disable arrow keys from the start** by adding these lines into your `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` file (previously `~/.vimrc`):

```
" don't use arrowkeys
noremap <Up> <NOP>
noremap <Down> <NOP>
noremap <Left> <NOP>
noremap <Right> <NOP>

" really, just don't
inoremap <Up>    <NOP>
inoremap <Down>  <NOP>
inoremap <Left>  <NOP>
inoremap <Right> <NOP>
```

**I usually advise already proficient `vim` users to not put anything they don't understand into their `init.vim` file**. Searching for a commands' meaning will lead you to a better understanding of `vim` and will give you the knowledge necessary to configure your tools so that they match your editing style and workflow.

Now you can go ahead and duck-duck-go the `noremap` and `inoremap` commands above if you're feeling adventurous.

Once you have gotten comfortable editing text, **start noticing [anti-patterns such as repeating the same key more than twice, repeating commands, or entering the insert mode to delete text](https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/vim-anti-patterns/)**.

**You should always be asking yourself if there is a better way of doing something**. Most of the time the answer will be "yes".

**Avoid plugins unless you definitely need them**. Most of the time, `vim` already has the feature you are looking for and it's better to not depend on any third-parties in this case. Using few plugins keeps your environment fast, free of bloat and will make it easier for you to use `vim` in any machine.

As a beginner, you don't exactly know what you need, so go ahead and add anything that you think might improve your workflow. **I usually recommend beginners to start with [`NERDTree`](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) and [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim)**. In the future, you will eventually want to trim your configs and remove the clutter.

Ultimately, the best tip I can give to anyone using `vim` is to adopt an incremental learning approach. Try to improve a little bit every day and avoid trying to learn too many techniques in a short period. You will use your text-editor of choice â€” hopefully `vim` â€” every single day, thus it is better to take a few days to assimilate a single command and use it for the rest of your life than to learn many tricks quickly and use them only once.

Dig deep, learn things properly and at a moderate pace. For that, I highly recommend [`vim Wikia`](http://vim.wikia.com).




## Plugins I'm Currently Using

To install and manage plugins you will probably want to use [`vim-plug`](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). It's minimalist, [easy to install](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#neovim), [easy to use](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#usage) and has many nice features such as [on-demand loading of plugins](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#on-demand-loading-of-plugins) and [post-update hooks](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#post-update-hooks) which allow you to configure instructions for extra installation steps.

[`neomake`](https://github.com/neomake/neomake) was `neovim`'s main selling point for me. It allows you to run programs asynchronously and therefore avoid blocking the main thread. This feature is especially useful for running syntax-checks or any other CPU intensive actions that would have previously caused `vim` to freeze for a few seconds.

[`NERDTree`](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) is an easy way of visualising and managing file trees. Even though all of its features have straightforward native alternatives, they are simply not as practical. I use the following lines to open it using `Ctrl+n` and show hidden files:

```
" NERDTree on ctrl+n
let NERDTreeShowHidden=1
map <silent> <C-n> :NERDTreeToggle<CR>

" close NERDTree after a file is opened
let g:NERDTreeQuitOnOpen=1
```

[`fzf.vim`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) does fuzzy-finding, allowing you to quickly find and open files by typing part of their names. Installing `fzf` is a bit more complicated than installing other plugins. Since `fzf.vim` is just a wrapper around `fzf`, you will need to use the following lines to ensure its binaries are installed.

```
Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'dir': '~/.fzf', 'do': './install --bin' }
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'
```

`fzf` can use other programs to find files, such as UNIX's `find` or [the silver searcher â€” also known as `ag`](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher). I like using `ag` because I can configure it to ignore the files I have in my `.gitignore` and therefore have pretty sensible defaults for whichever repository I'm working with.

```
" make FZF respect gitignore if `ag` is installed
" you will obviously need to install `ag` for this to work
if (executable('ag'))
    let $FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND = 'ag --hidden --ignore .git -g ""'
endif
```

Finally, I use the following to line to bind `fzf` to `ctrl+p`:

```
nnoremap <C-P> :Files<CR>
```

[`editorconfig-vim`](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vim) helps me quickly adapt my editor's settings to any project as long as it has [a `.editorconfig` file](https://editorconfig.org/). Thanks to it I don't have to worry about things like line-ending formats, and indentation size and characters.

[emmet-vim](https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim) makes it very quick to write HTML. If you write a lot of JSX â€” as I do â€” the following lines will make it work correctly when dealing with `.jsx` or `.tsx` files.

```
" make emmet behave well with JSX in JS and TS files
let g:user_emmet_settings = {
\  'javascript' : {
\      'extends' : 'jsx',
\  },
\  'typescript' : {
\      'extends' : 'tsx',
\  },
\}
```


I use [`ale`](https://github.com/w0rp/ale) as a linting engine because it works with most linters from most languages straight out-of-the-box. Using a single tool for all languages avoids all the pain I previously had configuring multiple plugins and then having to maintain all their configs. With `ale`, if you have `eslint` and an `.eslintrc` file in your project it will automatically run `eslint` with the correct settings and display the errors.

I also configured it to make linting seem faster, to remove any trailing lines and trim unnecessary whitespace.

```
" fix files on save
let g:ale_fix_on_save = 1

" lint after 1000ms after changes are made both on insert mode and normal mode
let g:ale_lint_on_text_changed = 'always'
let g:ale_lint_delay = 1000

" use nice symbols for errors and warnings
let g:ale_sign_error = 'âœ—\ '
let g:ale_sign_warning = 'âš \ '

" fixer configurations
let g:ale_fixers = {
\   '*': ['remove_trailing_lines', 'trim_whitespace'],
\}
```

**The most outstanding plugin in this list is probably [`YouCompleteMe`](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe)**, which gives me IDE-like semantic-based completion suggestions. `YouCompleteMe` suggestions take into account the meaning of the code (its semantics) rather than only searching for similar words (tokens).

The `YouCompleteMe` plugin is just a client that connects to the `YouCompleteMe` server, which is what actually generates the suggestions. This server works by running a different service for each language. For TypeScript, for example, `YouCompleteMe` runs the official `TSServer` made by Microsoft.

To install this plugin you also have to install the `YouCompleteMe` server:

```
" semantic-based completion
Plug 'Valloric/YouCompleteMe', { 'do': './install.py' }
```

If the command above is malfunctioning make sure to [check if your `neovim` supports python-based plugins](https://github.com/deoplete-plugins/deoplete-jedi/wiki/Setting-up-Python-for-Neovim#simple-setup) or try to run the `install.py` script â€” located at `~/.config/nvim/plugged/YouCompleteMe` â€” manually.

Needless to say â€” or maybe not so needless as I'm saying it already â€” it will be more useful for strongly typed languages. I have tested it mostly with `rust` and `TypeScript` and it's been fantastic.

I also use the following lines to bind its suggestions to `vim`'s default shortcut and popup for completion:

```
" disable auto_triggering ycm suggestions pane and instead
" use semantic completion only on Ctrl+n
let ycm_trigger_key = '<C-n>'
let g:ycm_auto_trigger = 0
let g:ycm_key_invoke_completion = ycm_trigger_key

" this is some arcane magic to allow cycling through the YCM options
" with the same key that opened it.
" See http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Improve_completion_popup_menu for more info.
let g:ycm_key_list_select_completion = ['<TAB>', '<C-j>']
inoremap <expr> ycm_trigger_key pumvisible() ? "<C-j>" : ycm_trigger_key;
```

My language-specific plugins are `rust.vim`, `vim-javascript` and `typescript-vim` since those are the languages I've been writing more frequently. I only add other language-specific plugins when I'm about to start writing in a new language. As you might have noticed, I'm a minimalist.




# `tmux`

`tmux` is a terminal multiplexer. Essentially, this is a fancy name for **a program which allows you to have multiple tabs and panes in a single terminal window**. It leverages the versatility of the terminal and makes it much more flexible.

If you are old enough to remember `IE6` and the gruesome experience of having to browse the web using a pile of windows, you will probably remember how big of an improvement it was when browsers introduced tabs. This is the same life-changing improvement `tmux` provides.

In `tmux` lingo, every tab is a `window` and a `window` can contain one or more `panes` (splits). These windows are contained within `sessions` that you can attach or detach to your current shell. When detaching a session, the `tmux` server will continue running it so that you can reattach whenever you find necessary. Having sessions in the background is also useful for keeping programs running while you work on different tasks.

Having multiple panes in a single window is terrific for when you are editing text and need to keep an eye on your tests, which run whenever you change a file, for example. It is also handy for running `git` commands in one pane and fixing conflicts in another.

The most significant advantage of using `tmux` is that you can run as many programs you want in parallel and see their outputs without having to drag panels around or toggle views using a graphical interface.

Working with many different tabs is also beneficial if you quickly need to switch to a different task but don't want to discard the context in which you are currently working.

`tmux`'s key-bindings consist of a `prefix` and the binding-keys themselves. To trigger a shortcut, press the `prefix` keys and then the bind-keys. If your prefix is, for example, `Ctrl+a` and your key-binding for opening a new horizontal split is `-`, then you will first press `Ctrl+a` and then press `-`. You can think of the `prefix` as the combination of keys that tell the terminal that you are going to use a `tmux` shortcut.

I find `tmux`'s default key-bindings to be a bit annoying, so I did some changes.

I currently use `C-a` as a prefix, `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` â€” the same direction keys as in `vim` â€” to switch between panes, and `-` and `|` to do horizontal and vertical splits.

```
# Free the original `Ctrl-b` prefix keybinding.
unbind C-b

# set prefix key to ctrl-a
set -g prefix C-a

# vi keys for switching panes
bind-key h select-pane -L
bind-key j select-pane -D
bind-key k select-pane -U
bind-key l select-pane -R

# Splitting panes.
bind - split-window -v
bind | split-window -h
```

To resize panes, I use `H`, `J`, `K`, and `L` â€” all uppercase.

```
# shift-movement keys will resize panes
bind J resize-pane -D 5
bind K resize-pane -U 5
bind H resize-pane -L 5
bind L resize-pane -R 5
```

I often use `prefix + z` to toggle a panel's fullscreen mode so that it becomes easier to read.

In the past, I have struggled with `tmux`'s way of copying text, so I have made some changes for it to work seamlessly.

First, I had to allow `tmux` to access the `OSX` pasteboard:

```
# Workaround to allow accessing OSX pasteboard
set-option -g default-command "reattach-to-user-namespace -l zsh"
```

Then I started using the same keys as I use in `vim` to select and copy text:

```
# Vi copypaste
setw -g mode-keys vi
unbind p
bind p paste-buffer
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi v send-keys -X begin-selection
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi y send-keys -X copy-selection-and-cancel
```

With these configurations, all you need to do whenever you need to scroll through your tmux panes and/or copy text is to press **`preffix+[` to start scrolling**, **`h j k l` (or `Ctrl+u` and `Ctrl+d`) to move the cursor**, **`v` or `shift+v` (for entire lines) for making a selection** and **`y` to copy the selection you made**.

Here are other small self-explanatory improvements:

```
# Start tabs at index 1
# (they usually start at 0, which is too far from where my fingers usually are)
set -g base-index 1

# Make pane numbering consistent with windows
setw -g pane-base-index 1

# Renumber windows when a window is closed
# This guarantees it will be easier for you to switch
# between windows as you keep opening and closing them
set -g renumber-windows on

# Automatically set window title according to the running program
set-window-option -g automatic-rename on
set-option -g set-titles on
```

## `tmux` plugins

To install and manage `tmux` plugins you will need [`tpm`](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm).

There is no point in replicating its installation instructions here, so [I'll just link to their README](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm#installation).

The theme I use for `tmux` is [my own fork of `nord-tmux`](https://github.com/lucasfcosta/nord-tmux/). I absolutely adore their colour scheme, but I wanted to customise my status-bar a bit more, hence why I have made my own fork. If you want to customise yours too, go ahead and fork their repository â€” or mine â€” and start pushing changes to it.

Once you have decided the theme you want to use, you can also add new plugins and customise your status bar.

If you want to display your battery percentage, for example, you can use [`tmux-battery`](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-battery) by adding the following line to your `.tmux.conf` and pressing `prefix + I` (capital I!) to install it.

```
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-battery'
```

Then just reference the plugin's items in your `status_bar` configuration:

```
set -g status-right 'Battery: #{battery_icon} #{battery_percentage} #{battery_remain} | %a %h-%d %H:%M '
```

You can find [a complete guide on how to configure your `status_bar` in the `tao-of-tmux` book](https://github.com/git-pull/tao-of-tmux/blob/master/manuscript/09-status-bar.md).

Here is a list of plugins I'm currently using:

* [`lucasfcosta/nord-tmux`](https://github.com/lucasfcosta/nord-tmux) â†’ my theme
* [`tmux-plugins/tmux-cpu`](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-cpu) â†’ shows information about CPU usage
* [`tmux-plugins/tmux-battery`](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-battery) â†’ shows battery stats
* [`tmux-plugins/tmux-online-status`](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-online-status) â†’ shows the connectivity status
* [`tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect`](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-ressurrect) â†’ persists sessions between shutdowns/restarts
* [`tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum`](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum) â†’ continuously saves and reloads sessions
* [`robhurring/tmux-spotify`](https://github.com/robhurring/tmux-spotify) â†’ displays currently playing spotify songs




# `zsh`

In UNIX, a shell does the job of providing you with a text-based interface to communicate with the underlying operating system. You can think of it as another way of telling your machine what it should do, but instead of clicking around and having all the clutter that graphical interfaces often display you type commands.

Usually, you will have `bash` set as your default shell (the `login shell`).

`zsh` is just another kind of shell â€” one which offers handy additional features.

To set up `zsh` as your `login shell`, you can use:

```
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

`zsh`'s auto-completion is far superior to the one in `bash`, both for file paths, for programs like `git`, and for [many others](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions). Just press `TAB` as you type a command and it will try to complete it for you.

`zsh` is highly extensible, hence why [`oh-my-zsh`](https://ohmyz.sh/) is so popular. `oh-my-zsh` is a framework for managing your `zsh` configuration that makes it effortless to add plugins, use themes and customise other relevant settings. You can find [the installation instructions for `oh-my-zsh` on their wiki](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH).

The configuration for `zsh` lives in a file called `.zshrc` located at your `home` directory (`~/.zshrc`). This file is executed in the current context whenever you open a new instance of the shell. Running it gives you access to any exported environment variables exported by it and lets you run any other necessary commands for setting up the shell's environment when it gets started. Executing a script in the current context is also known as "sourcing it" because the command which does this is `source`. Whenever you want an environment variable to be present in any new shell instance you create, add a line like this to your `.zshrc`.

```
# Use nvim as the default editor
export EDITOR=nvim
```

To keep my `.zshrc` clean I use an `.aliases` file. The filename is self-explanatory.

```
# Load aliases
if [ -f ~/.aliases ]; then
    . ~/.aliases
fi
```

You can see the contents of [my `.aliases` file on GitHub](https://github.com/lucasfcosta/dotfiles/blob/c01b73c6bd71b4888cae31440e14bf42297b3455/.aliases).

You can also use `.zshrc` to handle other convenient tasks such as setting up [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage your Node versions or setting up [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html) to work with `rust`:

```
# Add RVM to PATH for scripting. Make sure this is the last PATH variable change.
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion

# Add cargo to the PATH
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```



## `zsh` Plugins

My current `zsh` prompt is [the `spaceship-prompt`](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt). It is pretty, minimalist and includes emojis â€” an essential feature for millennials. [Installing it is quite simple, even more so if you're using `oh-my-zsh`](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt#oh-my-zsh).

My favourite plugin is definitely `z`. It allows you to jump to a directory without typing its full path. If you were in the directory `/Users/Elon/tesla/new-york`, switched to `/london` and now want to switch back to `new-york`, instead of typing the full path, you can just type `z new-york`.

`z` works by learning which directories you have been accessing more frequently and then uses that information to take you to the right place.

I also use [the `git` plugin](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/git), which is just [a bunch of convenient aliases for `git`](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/965a27aa69b49f4e447bcaae913e71a010f7d141/plugins/git/git.plugin.zsh#L36-L263). My favourite aliases are `g` for `git`, `gcm` for `git checkout master`, `gp` for `git push`, `gst` for `git status`, `grb` for `git rebase`, and `grba` and `grbc` for `git rebase --abort` and `git rebase --continue`.

If you're in an early 2000's vibe, you can install the `chucknorris` plugin and use the `chuck` command to get jokes that used to be funny.

![An ASCII drawing of a cow telling a Chuck Norris joke.](/assets/cowsay-chucknorris.png)


```
# .zshrc plugins section
plugins=(
  z
  git
  chucknorris # Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
)
```




## `iTerm2`

`iTerm2` is a terminal emulator. Not to be confused with a `shell`, a terminal emulator is just the window which *contains* the `shell`. The terminal emulator is responsible for how the `shell` is displayed.

`iTerm2` is nice because it lets me setup which fonts and colours I want to use.

By pressing `Ctrl+,` I get to configure its appearance and other useful settings.

My `iTerm2` uses [the `nord` iTerm colours](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-iterm2) to match with the rest of my themes and renders text using a `DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline` font.

[Powerline Fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) are also a neat thing to have. They include many characters used for text-based layouts such as the fill-blocks and triangles you can see in my `tmux` status-bar.

![My tmux status bar, showing the song currently playing, the date and time, the CPU percentage, the battery and connectivity status in a linear text-based interface](/assets/tmux-status-bar.png)

I use `iTerm2` simply because it's more customizable than Mac OS's default terminal. I don't need its window control features and tabs since I already use `tmux`.




## Other Useful Programs & Things to Know

The art of using the terminal as your primary interface to interact with the machine requires time and patience.

The hardest part is probably adding new tools to your workflow and getting used to them. Sometimes you don't even know there is a command-line alternative for something you want to do.

Here is a list of other useful programs to incorporate to your workflow.

* [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se/), for transferring data with URLs. I mostly use it to do HTTP requests.
* [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), for working with JSON.
* [`sed`](http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html), for transforming text. I adore `sed`.
* [`ag`](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher), for searching code.
* [`awk`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html), for transforming and extracting data. I don't use it much, but it is particularly useful for scripting or for combining programs effectively.
