I've been to São Paulo in order to get my US visa so I can talk at [FluentConf](https://conferences.oreilly.com/fluent/fl-ca) in California in June and while I was there my friend [@marquinhoalm](https://twitter.com/marquinhoalm) invited me to visit [Pagar.me](https://pagar.me/) and deliver a lightning talk.

It was great to make lots of new friends in a new city and their awesome office. I can't wait to go back to São Paulo!

I'd like to thank everyone at PagarMe for this incredible opportunity and for the politeness, good conversation and cups of coffee we've had.

You rock!
