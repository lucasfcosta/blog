This is my third talk, which was presented at JSDay Brazil on November 26th in the awesome city of Recife, Brazil.

In it I explain non-obvious facts to help people write better tests and I also present some thoughts about testing and its relation with software engineering in general.

**This talk features sign language interpreters!** Which is awesome, by the way.

Despite the awesome recording there was a little problem with my microphone's audio during the attendee's questions, but I hope you guys can hear it.

The keynote presentation for this talk can be found at [this SpeakerDeck link](https://speakerdeck.com/lucasfcosta/testes-em-js-como-voce-nunca-viu-antes).

Open Software is great software! Feel free to use the comments area to share your thoughts.
